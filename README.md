## Simple Topocentric Demo  

## Note: This project was originally created on **15 March 2022** during my undergraduate studies.  
## Iâ€™m publishing it here now for archiving purposes and to showcase my early MATLAB work.  

 This MATLAB project provides a **simple topocentric visualization** showing how an observer on Earth sees a target in 3D space.  
It converts geodetic coordinates to ECEF and visualizes the observer, target, Earth, and a simple reference orbit.  

# Features  
  - Prompts user for latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation, and range.  
  - Plots Earth as a sphere with adjustable scale.  
  - Shows observer and target points with a connecting line (line of sight).  
  - Adds a reference orbit for context.  

# Requirements    
- Basic understanding of coordinates and 3D plotting you can use the report for that  

# How to Run  
 1. just run:  
   ```bash
     main.m
